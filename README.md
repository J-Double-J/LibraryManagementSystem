This is a work in progress Library Management System. This is not a real product, but it will be (hopefully) a professional backend service. This is going to be one of the several microservices that I plan on making for this
on my journey of being a professional C# developer.

## Project Architecture

* ASP.NET Web API
* Clean Architecture (Domain Driven Design)
* CQRS Pattern
* Repository Pattern
* MediatR
* XUnit tests with Fluent Assertions
* Fluent Validation
* PostgreSQL Database
* CI/CD Pipeline
    * Run tests on every push
    * Deploys to Azure
* Result Pattern instead of Try-Catch handling
* Serilog

## Purpose

You may notice that there isn't a lot of meat on the project. That is partially intentional. There are a lot of tools out there to learn, patterns to explore, and DevOPs to experiment with. This is that projects purpose.
It has a functional goal of being a library system API, but underneath it is designed to a be resilient, scaleable, professional backend that experiments with these technologies. 

If you like what you see, feel free to reach out, I'd love to talk.
